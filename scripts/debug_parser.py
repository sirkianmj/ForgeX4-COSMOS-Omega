# Description:
# [PARSER DIAGNOSTIC TOOL] A robust debugging system to find the root cause
# of the "typedef flood." It isolates the C preprocessor step, records the
# exact command being run, and saves the complete, raw output for forensic
# analysis. This will provide definitive evidence of the parser's behavior.
